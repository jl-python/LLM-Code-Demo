## LLM-Code-Demo
> Week 2 - LLM

* This script provides hands on practice with LLM's and different methods or prompting and parameter adjusting. We go into a review of both models and examine their characteristics. You will see both models outputs for multiple prompts and how they generate various styles of writing and thinking.

* It tests prompting with two models - TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 & Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct both found on Hugging Face. The batch prompts are available to view in hf_qwen_batch_outputs.csv & hf_tiny_llama_batch_outputs.csv
