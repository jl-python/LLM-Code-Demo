# LLM-Code-Demo
Week 2 - LLM
This script provides hands on practice with LLM's and different methods or prompting and parameter adjusting.
It tests prompting with two models - TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 & Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct both found on Hugging Face.
We go into a review of both models and examine their characteristics. 
You will see both models outputs for multiple prompts and how they generate various styles of writing and thinking.
