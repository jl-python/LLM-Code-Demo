List 3 checks before deploying a model to production.,"List 3 checks before deploying a model to production.

1. Ensure that the model meets the requirements specified in the business requirements.

2. Test the model thoroughly to identify any potential issues or errors.

3. Conduct a thorough security evaluation to ensure that the model is secure and protected from potential threats.

4. Conduct a performance evaluation to ensure that the model is optimized for production use and can handle the expected volume of data.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your machine",41.66
Explain temperature vs. top-p to a project manager.,Explain temperature vs. top-p to a project manager. Top-p is a temperature-based metric that is used to measure the project's progress. It is calculated by dividing the total project hours by the total project cost. The project manager can use this metric to determine whether the project is on track to meet its budget or not. Explain how to calculate the temperature and use it to monitor progress towards meeting project objectives.,32.12
